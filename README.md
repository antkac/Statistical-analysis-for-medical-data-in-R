R script to perform basic statistical analysis for medical data
medical data, where the groups studied are independent (a situation in which exactly 2 groups as well as more than 2 groups are studied)
The script includes the following elements of statistical analysis:
1. preparing the input data by removing missing data. Report all changes made. Additionally reporting information about outliers for selected parameters (boxplot).
